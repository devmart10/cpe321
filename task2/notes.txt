How hard would it be for an adversary to solve the Diffie Hellman Problem (DHP) given these parameters? 
It would not be hard as with p being 37, there are only 37 possible s given s = B^a mod P.

What strategy might the adversary take?
Adversary would only need to brute force the possible values of s and generate 37 keys, and one of the keys will decode the messages successfully.


Would the same strategy used for the tiny parameters work here?
No it would not.
Why or why not?
There would be 2.79E539 possible values for s, which would not be possible to brute force easily.
